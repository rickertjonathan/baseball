A poem on baseball and bats

It’s about
the ball,
the bat,
and the mitt.
Ball hits
bat, or it
hits mitt.
Bat doesn’t
hit ball, bat
meets it.
Ball bounces
off bat, flies
air, or thuds
ground (dud)
or it
finds the mitt.
In order to
hit a baseball
over the fence,
you need to swing
for the fences.
The yankees are
the best baseball team
of all time.
They have won
27 championships.
